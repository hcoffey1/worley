# Worley Noise Generator

## Intro

This project is an SDL2 based implementation of the Worley noise algorithm. 
The algorithm is simple, but creates some really interesting patterns,
and offers plenty of opportunities for customization to create your own
designs. I was first introduced to Worley noise by The Coding Train's
video on the topic where he does a great job on explaining it. I've
placed a link below for both his video, and his code examples hosted
on Github.

## Examples

GIFs aren't really the best for displaying the output 
(my setup isn't great either), but I've put together a couple examples
from different configurations I've tried.

 specified depth.**
